# <p align="center">What is Superior Smelting?
</p>

**<p align="center">Superior Smelting is an expansion of Minecraft's vanilla smelting mechanics. Ever thought that a golden chestplate smelting down into a single gold nugget was a ripoff? Well, now you get an ingot! Have you ever bulk crafted an inventory full of diamond helmets on accident? Now you can smelt some of those down in the blast furnace to get your diamonds back! Or have you ever wanted to smelt a cobblestone stair into a stone stair? Well now you can do that, too! And, of course, there's built-in compatibility for all your favorite mods!**

**<p align="center">See below for a closer look into the two main features:**

## ‚õèÔ∏èMetal Smelting

### <p align="center">Melt Back Into Ingots (or nuggets)

**<p align="center">Get something out of your junk.**

**<p align="center">In general, if the item is crafted with 3 or more ingots, you get an ingot back.**
**<p align="center">Otherwise, you get a nugget.**

<summary>Various Inspirations</summary>

Burning moss off of stone is inspired by the [Remove Moss from Stone](https://modrinth.com/datapack/remove-moss) datapack. If you just want this feature, I suggest checking it out. It also supports lower MC version than I do currently.

[notblue](https://modrinth.com/user/notblue) also made several other metal recycling and stone shortcut datapacks that I took ideas from. Highly recommend checking them out.
